# API Test Automation ‚Äî HW9 & HW10

This project contains automated API test scenarios for two backend endpoints:

Each set of tests covers key validation logic, decision outcomes and edge case handling to ensure reliability and security.

---

## `/test-orders` ‚Äî HW9

Supports **GET**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** methods to manage test orders. Tests include valid cases, invalid input, and API key handling.

### Test Cases

| 1   | GET existing order                       | ID = 1                       | 200 OK           |
| 2   | GET non-existing order                   | ID = 999999                  | 400 Bad Request  |
| 3   | PUT valid update with API key            | Valid body + correct API key | 200 OK           |
| 4   | PUT with missing/invalid fields          | Invalid body                 | 400 Bad Request  |
| 5   | PUT with invalid API key                 | Wrong key                    | 401 Unauthorized |
| 6   | DELETE existing order with valid API key | ID = 1                       | 204 No Content   |
| 7   | DELETE with ID = 0                       | Edge case ID                 | 400 Bad Request  |
| 8   | DELETE non-existent ID                   | ID = 999999                  | 400 Bad Request  |

## `/loan-calc/decision` ‚Äî HW10

Calculates loan risk and returns a loan decision. Tests cover risk levels, validation errors, and content type checks.
